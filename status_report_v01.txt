2/15/2017 accomplishment summary:
Previously Working assets
	~> actor keyboard control and environment fully drawn.
	
Updated Assets:
RNG arrow spawn completed.
Game Over boolean completed. (Collision detected)
	~> If arrow point contacts actor (black or white), game over is true
Debugged hidden issue. (Canvas wasn't being cleared properly)
Reusability and refactorability.
	~> Color scheme is easily modifiable for whole game
	~> reusable variable created (actor speed)
	~> reusable local/global variables (primaryFill, secondaryFill, stroke, fill, etc.)
Background-color: gray;
User controls and objective are displayed.

	
- TODO:
- Score count incrementing by 301
- User Interface and startup menu (start, options, about)
	~> Start: prompt for difficulty setting (to be implemented) then begin game
	~> Options: A color scheme controller, maybe audio
	~> About: Write about myself building the project
	
* Catcher Mode: black box dodges arrows and white box catches arrows for score.
	~> Dodge yields no score but catch does.
	
- More TODO:
- Implement Time into RNG potentially ,
- Start arrows above canvas (improve reusability of y variable calculations)

if(!gameOver && arrowY == canvas.height){
	scoreCounter+=301;
}
