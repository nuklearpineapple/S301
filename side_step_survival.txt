Initial Concept Date: 2/13/2017

Goal: Build a game in javascript to link on my website

Genres:
Turn-Based text game. (Either combat, or an object progresses when you answer correctly)
2D platforming square object.
2D space combat. (Asteroids or something similar)


Final Determined result: 
2D evasion. ("Project S301" )
*S3 v01* S3 stands for Side-Step Survival

"S301"
So what would we need, we need deadly projectiles starting 
from above the canvas and getting thrown down at an actor. 

* Arrows (black and white)

Shadows may appear below a position where a projectile is set to fall down on.

* Oval projections for shadows

The shadow concept may be apparent only in 
"Simple Mode"

Power ups may be available in 
"Simple Mode"

The shadow concept will not appear in 
"Complex mode"

Power ups may or may not be available in 
"Complex Mode" 
(Maybe less frequent spawn percentage)

The actor will be able to traverse left and right to avoid the projectiles. 
"Simple Mode" (left) (right) // Control black and white box
"Complex Mode" (left) (right) (A) (D) // Control black , Control white box

Score will be rewarded adding 301 per projectile avoided. 
initial score: 301
final score: (301 x projectiles avoided) (301 x bonuses applied)

-Brainstorming notes-

If an arrow is approaching, 
a shadow fades into existence and 
when the arrow passes through the ground,
the arrow will have an effect of passing through another dimension
because the arrow is a white arrow outlined black.

* Arrow color white with black outline.

The Main actor can be black over white and white over black.
In "Complex Mode" the player will have to control white and black,
protecting them from the opposing colors arrows. 
Black and White arrows will only appear in "Complex Mode."

* Main actor black and white. Independent halves of 1 whole.
